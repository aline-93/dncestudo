# CS & Support Automation – Power Automate Workflow

## Overview
This project documents a customer support and customer success automation workflow built using Microsoft Power Automate.  
The goal is to structure customer interactions, create traceable tasks, and generate visibility into support and CS workload without manual tracking.

This workflow was designed to improve organization, response quality, and internal visibility for support and CS activities.

---

## Problem
Customer interactions often happen across informal channels (e.g. WhatsApp), which can make it difficult to:
- Track support requests consistently
- Measure CS and support workload
- Ensure follow-up and accountability
- Provide visibility to leadership

---

## Solution
A structured Power Automate workflow that:
- Uses a checklist-based form to classify customer interactions
- Automatically creates tasks in Microsoft Planner
- Tags tasks as Customer Success or Support
- Enables workload tracking and reporting
- Reduces manual effort and missed follow-ups

---

## Workflow Description
1. Customer interaction occurs (e.g. via WhatsApp)
2. Support/CS agent fills out a structured form with clear checkboxes:
   - Type of request (Support / CS / Follow-up)
   - Priority
   - Customer
   - Short description
3. Power Automate triggers:
   - Task creation in Microsoft Planner
   - Automatic categorization
   - Timestamp and ownership assignment
4. Tasks are used to:
   - Track workload
   - Improve visibility for leadership
   - Support performance and reporting
